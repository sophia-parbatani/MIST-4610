   # Database Description
   Our Bookstore Database Management System helps to streamling bookstore operations. Management of a bookstore requires careful tracking of many different records. This includes, but is not limited to, inventory, organization, sales, and even employee information. Mantaining an efficient and easily accesible storage of this information helps the bookstore to gain important insight on the outcomes of their investments and how they can be maximized for the greatest return.
